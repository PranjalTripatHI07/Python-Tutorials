#Topic Reading from a file
#=> When we  want to work with the information in a text file the first step is
# to read the file into memory

#1. Reading the content of a file

from pathlib import Path  # Pathlib is a module in Python that provides an object-oriented interface for handling filesystem paths.
                          # It simplifies path manipulations and operations such as creating,
                          # deleting, moving, renaming, reading, writing, finding, or splitting files.

                          # And Path is the class inside pathlib module file

path = Path("samplefile.txt") # create a path object(instance) for class Path and pass the text file name which we created as argument of Path class
show_file_content = path.read_text() # Create a variable and call the path object(instance) and use the Path class function name read_text()
                                     # This read_text() function basically read the text present inside the file


print(show_file_content)# Here we simply print the content of the file by calling the variable inside the print statement
#or
print(path.read_text())
