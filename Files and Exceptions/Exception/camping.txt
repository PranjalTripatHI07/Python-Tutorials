Prepare Your Gear

There are a million things you can bring with you on a camping trip, but you should prioritize the ones that can save you, your family or friends’ life.First-aid kits are worth every inch of space in your bag, as are emergency gear. Make a checklist in an app or by using pen and paper and write down these items- a whistle, compass, a basic tool kit, 2-way radios, heat lamps, lanterns or flashlights, bug spray, water and toilet paper. Check the list off as you put the things in your backpack.If you have the time, take a crash course on basic first aid and learn about the most common illnesses and injuries so you’ll know how to deal with them.
